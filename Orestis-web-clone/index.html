                <h2>MY FIRST THEOREM </h2>
                <p>Pick a number at random between a and b. Repeat this n times. 
                    Plot a histogram (density) of the resulting numbers and you will find that it 
                    follows this distribution which I proved using 
                    Fourier analysis together with my PhD supervisor Prof Carl Dettmann.</p>

                <h2>MY FIRST BOOK</h2>
                <img src="Photo5.jpg" alt="orestis's book" width="500">
                <p>This is a book about mid-air haptics, generated by ultrasound phased arrays, 
                    and the novel human-computer interaction (HCI) paradigms it enables.
                    It’s co-edited with William Frier, Euan Freeman, Claudio Pacchierotti, 
                    and Takayuki Hoshi, and co-authored with 30+ experts in the field. </p>

                <h2>Talking with an AI</h2>
                <img src="photo6.jpg" alt="orestis talking to an ai" width="500">
                <p>I believe that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be the most 
                    significant invention in the history of humanity. 
                    In this blog, I had the opportunity to talk to one.</p>

                <h2>PUBLICATIONS</h2>
                <img src="photo7.jpg" alt="orestis publications" width="500">
                <p>Publishing has allowed me to network with other scholars and to 
                    further refine my own ideas and research. It’s something I enjoy immensely and 
                    hope that these papers will help others 
                    further their science and welcome any opportunities to collaborate.</p>

                <h2>Trajectory</h2>
                <img src="photo9.jpg" alt="computer photo" width="500">
                <p>My exposure to both academic and industrial settings (large and small) over 
                    the past 10 years has taught me to think strategically, pragmatically, and scientifically, 
                    positioning me as someone able to imagine, connect and direct 
                    research efforts towards tangible objectives and strategic targets.</p>
